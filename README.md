# 🚗 Indian EV Market Analysis - AtliQ Motors Case Study

This project is based on a real-world inspired case study from Codebasics. It focuses on analyzing the electric vehicle (EV) market in India to help AtliQ Motors, an automotive giant, expand its presence in the country.  

## 📌 Project Overview  
AtliQ Motors, with a 25% market share in North America, aims to grow its footprint in India. This project involved solving complex business questions using SQL, data cleaning in Excel, and building an **interactive dashboard in Power BI** for strategic insights.

### 🔍 Key Objectives  
1. Analyze EV sales penetration and growth trends across states.  
2. Identify top-performing EV makers and states (2022–2024).  
3. Project future sales and calculate CAGR for decision-making.  
4. Create a dashboard for visual insights into EV trends and patterns.
